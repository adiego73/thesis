\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

First of all, I want to thank Prof. Matteo Matteucci for trusting in me to work in this project and for his infinite patience to guide me. Without his guide, I would still be reading papers and trying to understand some processes and results. I want to thanks Simone Mentasti and Gabriele Roggi for their advises, I hope the next student find your advises and this work as useful as I did.\\

Second, I want to thank my girlfriend and future wife, Victoria, for convince me to start this journey, it wouldn't be the same without you and your support. Of course, I want to thank my family in Argentina, this wouldn't be possible without you either. Thank you for your support and encourage, it is a pity that because of this pandemic you cannot be here with me. I miss you, and I hope we can be together again.\\

Finally, I want to thank my friends, the ones I've made here in Italy and those in Argentina, particularly to Andr√©s. You've being a mentor and a guide, and without your advises and friendship I wouldn't be here. \\

To all of you, thank you.
